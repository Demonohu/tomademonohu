            <p class='infoAboutP'>Pontederia crassipes - commonly known as common water hyacinth, (and also known as the
                "terror of Bengal"; generally in Bengali it is often called 'kochuripana') - is an aquatic plant native
                to the Amazon basin, and is often a highly problematic invasive species outside its native range. It is
                the sole species of Pontederia subg. Oshunae.[2] Water hyacinth is a free-floating perennial aquatic
                plant (or hydrophyte) native to tropical and sub-tropical South America. With broad, thick, glossy,
                ovate leaves, water hyacinth may rise above the surface of the water as much as 1 meter (3 feet) in
                height. The leaves are 10–20 cm (4–8 inches) across on a stem which is floating by means of buoyant
                bulb-like nodules at its base above the water surface. They have long, spongy and bulbous stalks. The
                feathery, freely hanging roots are purple-black. An erect stalk supports a single spike of 8–15
                conspicuously attractive flowers, mostly lavender to pink in colour with six petals. When not in bloom,
                water hyacinth may be mistaken for frog's-bit (Limnobium spongia[3]) or Amazon frogbit (Limnobium
                laevigatum).

                One of the fastest-growing plants known, water hyacinth reproduces primarily by way of runners or
                stolons, which eventually form daughter plants. Each plant additionally can produce thousands of seeds
                each year, and these seeds can remain viable for more than 28 years.[4] Some water hyacinths were found
                to grow between 2 and 5 meters (7 and 16 feet) a day in some sites in Southeast Asia.[5] The common
                water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) are vigorous growers and mats can double in size in one to two
                weeks.[6] And in terms of plant count rather than size, they are said to multiply by more than a
                hundredfold in number, in a matter of 23 days.

                In their native range, these flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees and they can reproduce both
                sexually and clonally.
